ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš© **WARNING** ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš© 
## TLSharp LIBRARY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED    

As a workaround you can use -> [TelegramClient](https://github.com/miladsoft/TelegramClient)

WTelegramClient is another C#/.NET open-source library for accessing Telegram Client API and is:
- offering up-to-date API (latest layer)
- safer (latest MTProto v2 implementation and many security checks)
- feature-complete (handling of updates, multiple-DC connections)
- easy-to-use (API calls are direct methods with fully documented parameters in VS)
- designed for .NET 5.0+, but also available for .NET Standard 2.0 (.NET Framework 4.6.1+ & .NET Core 2.0+)
